# Springboard Data Science Career Track

Hi!

My name is Mikiko Bazeley and this is my repo for the Springboard Data Science Track. 

From Oct 2018 to April 2019 I completed a number of projects, including two capstones, as part of the DS track. 

All of the documentation, code, and notes can be found here, as well as links to other resources I found helpful for successfully completing the program. 

For questions or comments, please feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikikobazeley/). 

Regards,
Mikiko
